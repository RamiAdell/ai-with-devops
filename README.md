# 🚀 AutoScalerAI – Intelligent Scaling & Cost Optimization

AI‑Powered Predictive Autoscaling & Cost Optimization for Cloud Infrastructure. AutoScalerAI forecasts demand, makes proactive scaling decisions, and automates infrastructure changes to keep latency low and cloud bills under control.

- **Status**: Frontend landing page (no backend) – ideal for portfolio and concept showcase

## ✨ What is AutoScalerAI?

AutoScalerAI is a DevOps + AI concept that predicts traffic using time‑series models and scales your infrastructure **before** the spike hits. It integrates with familiar tooling (Terraform, Kubernetes, Prometheus) and can either automate changes or propose them for human review.

## 🔧 Key Features

- **Predictive Autoscaling**: Forecasts traffic using models like Prophet/LSTM to pre‑scale services.
- **Intelligent Cost Optimization**: Rightsizes capacity, blends spot/on‑demand, minimizes idle waste.
- **Proactive Resource Allocation**: Pre‑warms services/caches and shifts load ahead of hotspots.
- **Automated Provisioning & Scaling**: Applies infra updates via Terraform/Ansible, updates HPAs/ASGs.
- **Deep Integrations**: Terraform • Kubernetes • Prometheus • Grafana • ArgoCD • OpenAI • Python.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Pipeline stages:
1. **Data Ingestion** → Metrics from Prometheus, CloudWatch, logs, custom events.
2. **AI Prediction Engine** → Time‑series forecasting (Prophet/LSTM) on resource usage and demand.
3. **Decision Layer** → Policy & risk budgets determine safe, cost‑efficient actions.
4. **Automation Layer** → Terraform/Ansible, HPAs/ASGs, cloud APIs apply changes.
5. **Visualization** → Grafana dashboards, Slack bot notifications and summaries.

The landing page includes an inline SVG diagram and section summaries for each stage.

## 🔁 Workflow

1. Collect metrics (Prometheus, CloudWatch)
2. Predict demand with AI (Prophet, LSTM)
3. Trigger scaling decisions (policy + SLO budgets)
4. Automate infrastructure changes (Terraform, Ansible / K8s HPA)
5. Visualize insights (Grafana, Slack Bot)

## ✅ Benefits

- **Reduced Downtime**: Pre‑scale to avoid SLO violations during bursts.
- **Lower Cloud Costs**: Scale down intelligently during lulls; rightsize continuously.
- **Smarter Infrastructure**: Policy‑driven decisions anchored in SLOs and risk tolerance.
- **Automated Operations**: Less toil; more time for product and reliability work.

## 🧰 Tech Stack (Concept)

- Infra: Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes (HPA/VPA)
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana
- CI/CD: ArgoCD (GitOps)
- AI: Python models (Prophet, LSTM), optional OpenAI for reasoning/assistive decisions
- Messaging: Slack bot for change proposals and summaries

## 🧪 Project Status

This repository hosts a static, responsive landing page demonstrating the concept. It uses Tailwind CSS via CDN and minimal JavaScript for smooth scrolling and scroll‑triggered animations.

## 🖥️ Local Preview

Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build step required.

## 🚀 Deploy (GitHub Pages)

This site is deployed as a GitHub Pages project site.

1. Commit `index.html` at repo root.
2. GitHub → Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: `Deploy from a branch`.
3. Select `main` and folder `/root` → Save.
4. It will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## ✍️ Customization

- Update CTA button links in the "Contact" section of `index.html` (GitHub URL, email).
- Edit content in each section to reflect your environment and preferences.
- Tailwind is loaded via CDN; no build pipeline required.

## ♿ Accessibility & UX

- High‑contrast dark theme with a DevOps aesthetic.
- Smooth scrolling and IntersectionObserver‑based reveals (respects `prefers-reduced-motion`).
- Keyboard focus states preserved for interactive elements.

## 🧭 Talking Points (for interviews/class)

- “An AI‑powered autoscaler that predicts traffic and proactively scales infra, reducing downtime and cost.”
- “Integrates Prometheus, Terraform, Kubernetes, and a forecasting model to make scaling intelligent rather than reactive.”
- “Balances cost and reliability using policy‑driven decisions and risk budgets.”
